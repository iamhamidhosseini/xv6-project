xv6 Project - Custom Modifications
This project contains custom modifications to the standard xv6 operating system, with a focus on two main changes:

Changing the shell prompt symbol from > to $.

Colorizing the word "OS" whenever it appears in the shell output.

Changes Made
1. Changed Shell Prompt Symbol to $
The first modification involved changing the default shell prompt from > to $. This is a small but significant visual change, making the shell prompt look more familiar and standardized for many Unix-like systems.

Files Modified:

sh.c

In this step, all occurrences of > in the shell prompt logic were replaced with $. This provides a more recognizable prompt for users working within the shell.

2. Colorized the Word "OS"
The second modification was focused on colorizing the word "OS" when it appears in the shell output. This is a fun and visually engaging change to highlight the word "OS" by printing it in blue whenever it's encountered.

Files Modified:

exec.c

sh.c

The code was modified to check for the word "OS" (in any case combination) in the output and print it in blue. This makes "OS" stand out whenever itâ€™s mentioned in the shell output, improving the user experience with more colorful output.
